# Models
All JSON models/animations can be edited and created with Blockbench (though you might need some minor tweaking of the JSON when finished).
- For the table_wood, I was able to copy the original files (model and texture) into the assets, open it within Blockbench, select the model's parts, then copy the texture as a new texture with a block layout instead of the standard layout. I'll make a video of this in the future.
- The v4 and v6 models are a bit of a mess, but they should work fine out of the box. I only cleaned up the table_wood to try it out.
- The TC model's reference paths should be correct by default if the folder structure was configured correctly.
